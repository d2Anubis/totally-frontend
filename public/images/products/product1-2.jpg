<!-- This is a placeholder for a JPEG image file. Since binary files can't be created directly through text editing, you would need to manually add an actual image file at this location. -->

<!-- The file should be named product1-2.jpg and placed in the public/images/products directory -->

<!-- If you want to use real product images, please upload actual image files to this directory. -->
